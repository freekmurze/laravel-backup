This Laravel 5 package creates a backup of your application. The backup is a zipfile that contains all files in the directories you specify along with a dump of your database. The backup can be stored on [any of the filesystems you have configured in Laravel 5](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/filesystem).

Feeling paranoid about backups? No problem! You can backup your application to multiple filesystems at once.

## Prerequisites
To create a dump of a MySQL-db this packages uses the ```mysqldump```-binary. Make sure it is installed on your system.

## Install

You can install this package via composer using:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-backup
```

You must also install this service provider.

```php

// config/app.php

'providers' => [
    ...
    'Spatie\Backup\BackupServiceProvider',
    ...
];
```

To publish the config file to ``app/config/laravel-backup.php`` run:

``` bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Backup\BackupServiceProvider"
```

This is the contents of the configuration. These options should be self-explanatory.
```php
return [

    'source' => [

        'files' => [

            /*
             * The list of directories that should be part of the backup. You can
             * specify individual files as well.
             */
            'include' => [
                base_path(),
            ],

            /*
             * These directories will be excluded from the backup.
             * You can specify individual files as well.
             */
            'exclude' => [
                storage_path(),
                base_path('vendor'),
            ],
        ],

        /*
         * Should the database be part of the back up.
         */
        'backup-db' => true,
    ],

    'destination' => [

        /*
         * The filesystem(s) you on which the backups will be stored. Choose one or more
         * of the filesystems you configured in app/config/filesystems.php
         */
        'filesystem' => ['local'],

        /*
         * The path where the backups will be saved. This path
         * is relative to the root you configured on your chosen
         * filesystem(s).
         *
         * If you're using the local filesystem a .gitignore file will
         * be automatically placed in this directory so you don't
         * accidentally end up committing these backups.
         */
        'path' => 'backups',
    ],

    /*
     * The path to the mysqldump binary. You can leave this empty
     * if the binary is installed in the default location.
     */
    'mysql' => [
        'dump_command_path' => '',
    ],
    
    /*
     * Number of days before backup-files expire.
     */
    'expirationDays' => 90
];


```

## Usage

### Backup

Use this command start the backup and store the zipfile to the filesystem(s) you specified:

``` bash
php artisan backup:run
```

A zip-file, containing all files in the directories you specified along the dump of your database, will be created on the filesystem(s) you specified in the config-file.

### Cleanup

You can also specify an amount of days it takes for a backup-file to expire.

Running this command will remove all 'expired' files from all the specified filesystems:

``` bash
php artisan backup:clean
```



## Testing

Run the tests with:

``` bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
